Two separate methods for developing web applications are Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR), each with pros and cons of their own.

HTML is created on the server and sent to the client using SSR. Fast first page loads are the main benefit of SSR, as they are essential for both SEO and user experience. SSR makes sure that users with less powerful devices or sluggish network connections can still access the material easily. SSR may not be as effective for dynamic, single-page apps and can be resource-intensive on the server, slowing down server response times.

CSR, on the other hand, loads a minimum HTML shell and uses JavaScript to render the website and fetch data. CSR is excellent at offering responsive user interfaces and quick page transitions. For online applications that need to be updated often without requiring a complete page reload, it is a great option. CSR, however, may result in slower initial page loads, difficulties with SEO (which can be addressed with the right methods), and possible problems with usability for users on slower or JavaScript-disabled devices.

To sum up, the decision between SSR and CSR is based on the particular needs of your online application. While CSR works best for dynamic, app-like experiences, SSR is better for websites that are heavy on content or that are SEO-sensitive. Hybrid rendering—a combination of the two techniques—can sometimes provide the best of both worlds by addressing the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology to produce a comprehensive online application.
